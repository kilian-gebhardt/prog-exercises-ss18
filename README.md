## Run a program from terminal
- `cd` to the directory containing the `.hs`-Files.
- start `ghci`
- type, e.g., `:load task-01.hs` 
- call one of the functions by typing its name and fitting arguments, e.g., `sumFacs 2 4`
- to enable time measurements type `:set +s` in `ghci`
- to create a list of integers from `a` to `b` type `[a..b]`
